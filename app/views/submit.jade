  h2.title-hed Submit a Talk 
  
  p Submit your proposal to speak at Boston Data Vis! 
  
  p A proposal can be just a 4-5 sentence paragraph about the subject you want to discuss. Any reference materials you already 
  have about this (links to live demos, existing presentations, videos etc.) would be very helpful!
  
  p We welcome - and encourage - folks with different levels of experience to submit talks! Even if you feel you are "new" or "just learning", consider submitting your idea, or talk to us at a meetup about it! We really believe that everyone in the community has something to offer everyone else in the community regardless of age, gender, race, sexual orientation, or skill level.

  p Boston Data Vis expects all speakers and attendees to follow the 
    a(href="http://bocoup.com/community/conduct") Bocoup Code of Conduct.
